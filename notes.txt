STORE:
    • A map of collaborators -> collaborators
    • A map of schools -> publications
    • A map of publications -> collaborators
    • A map of publications -> schools
    • Adjacency matrix

GIVEN: a list of collaborators and their info
TODO:
    For each collaborator:
        • Create new collaborator object
        • Create new school object and add to list of schools if not already there
            - Keep count of # of schools, giving each one a unique ID
        • Add collaborator to school.collaborators
        numSchools++

matrix[numSchools][numSchools]

Brainstorm:
• Open page: load all the markers (each reprsenting a school)
• Click on marker: list of all collaborators from that school
    - All outgoing edges from the collaborators from that school
    for each school {
        for (collaborator in school.collaborators) {
            for (friend in collaborator.friends) {
                matrix[school.id][friend.school.id] += 1;
                matrix[friend.schoo.id][school.id] += 1;
            }
        }
